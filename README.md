# 🚀 AI-Powered SQL Assistant  

An **AI-driven SQL Assistant** that converts **natural language queries** into **SQL queries** based on a given database schema. 🧠💻  
This tool makes querying databases **effortless** and **efficient**, helping users save time and reduce errors.  

## 🌟 Why I Built This App  
I built this app to showcase the power of **AI-driven automation** and **OpenAI's natural language processing** capabilities.  
- 🔥 **Bridges the gap** between non-SQL users and databases  
- ⚡ **Saves time** by auto-generating SQL queries  
- 🛠 **Reduces errors** compared to manually writing SQL  

As **AI continues to evolve**, developers need to **adapt and innovate**! This project helps in understanding **how AI can enhance developer productivity**.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- ⚡ **Node.js** – Backend for handling API calls  
- 🧠 **OpenAI API** – Converts text into SQL queries  
- 🎨 **React & Next.js** – Frontend for an intuitive UI  
- 🔄 **XState** – Manages state transitions  
- 🌐 **Express.js** – API routing and middleware  
- 💾 **SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL** – Supports various databases
